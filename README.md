# Genetic Algorithm for Black Box Array Problem

## Problem Statement

The Black Box Array Problem involves a scenario where we have a box from which we can retrieve the type of item stored in the box, the total number of items, and a comparison score. The comparison score represents the similarity between an array of items and the items stored in the box. The goal is to find the array of items that matches the items in the box most closely.

## Project Goals

The primary objective of this project is to solve the Black Box Array Problem using genetic algorithms. Genetic algorithms are a heuristic search technique inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics. By evolving a population of candidate solutions over multiple generations, genetic algorithms can efficiently search through a large solution space to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex optimization problems.

### Specific Goals:

1. Implement various genetic algorithm strategies for solving the Black Box Array Problem.
2. Experiment with different approaches for selection, mutation, and crossover operators.
3. Explore the effects of different parameters, such as population size, mutation rate, and crossover rate, on algorithm performance.
4. Investigate the impact of different selection strategies, including roulette wheel selection, tournament selection, and rank selection.
5. Evaluate the performance of the genetic algorithm using different metrics, such as convergence rate, solution quality, and computational efficiency.
6. Compare the performance of genetic algorithm variants with other optimization algorithms or heuristic search techniques.
7. Visualize and interpret the results to gain insights into the effectiveness and trade-offs of different genetic algorithm configurations.
